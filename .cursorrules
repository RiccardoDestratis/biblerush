# Cursor Rules for BibleRush Quiz Game

## Development Workflow

### Cache Clearing
- **After bigger changes** (schema updates, major refactors, environment variable changes), always run `pnpm dev:clean` instead of `pnpm dev`
- This clears the Next.js cache (.next) and node_modules/.cache before restarting the dev server
- Prevents stale content and caching issues

### Package Manager
- **ALWAYS use pnpm** - never use npm or yarn
- All package management commands must use pnpm

### Testing
- Before committing, always test if all new changes work perfectly and the app did not break
- Build the app: `pnpm build`
- Run tests using backend and frontend testing (e.g., browser tab)
- Only commit after successful testing

### Environment Files
- The env files are not accessible to read - don't try to read them
- Always assume they are correct
- Use environment variables via `process.env` or helper functions

### Git Workflow
- Regularly commit to git when a new feature has successfully been implemented
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Follow the branch strategy: feature branches from `staging`, merge to `staging`, then to `main` for production

### Code Quality
- No unconventional hot fixes - if stuck after 2 tries, research the problem online and come up with a sustainable solution
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
