Project Brief: Bible Memory Quiz Game
Date: November 19, 2025
Created By: Business Analyst (Mary)
Project Status: Planning Phase - Ready for PM Handoff

Executive Summary
Bible Memory Quiz Game is a real-time, competitive quiz platform designed specifically for Christian communities to make scripture memorization engaging and fun. The application enables church groups, youth ministries, and small groups to run interactive quiz events where participants use their phones to answer Bible questions while a central projector displays AI-generated visuals and live leaderboards.
The platform addresses a critical gap in Christian education technology: most Bible learning tools are either outdated desktop software or individual study apps that lack social engagement. Our solution combines the viral gameplay mechanics of Kahoot with biblically-accurate, AI-enhanced visual content to create memorable learning experiences that churches will want to use repeatedly.
Target Market: Youth pastors, small group leaders, senior pastors, and church event coordinators who need engaging tools for groups of 10-50 people.
Business Model: Freemium B2C (individuals/small groups get limited access) converting to B2B church licensing ($299/year) for unlimited features.
MVP Timeline: 4-6 weeks to launch with 5 curated question sets (100 total questions).

Problem Statement
Current State:
Christian education and community building in church settings faces several interconnected challenges:
Entertainment & Community Gap: Churches need fun, engaging activities that bring people together and create memorable shared experiences. Current options are either too serious (traditional Bible study) or completely secular (generic party games), missing the sweet spot of entertainment that's also spiritually meaningful.
Learning Through Fun: While scripture memorization and Bible knowledge are important goals, the primary need is making Bible engagement enjoyable and social. Traditional methods (rote repetition, worksheets) fail to create the excitement and energy that competitive games naturally generate.
Event Coordination Burden: Churches struggle to find ready-to-use activities for youth nights, small group gatherings, and church events. Youth pastors and event coordinators spend hours creating Bible content from scratch using generic tools like Kahoot, which wasn't designed for ministry and lacks any Bible-specific features.
Fragmented Solutions:
Bible quiz apps only work for individual study, not group events
Kahoot/generic platforms require creating all Bible content manually with no theological guidance
Formal Bible quiz programs are too structured and competitive for casual church gatherings
No solution exists that's purpose-built for casual, fun church events
Missing Social Dynamic: Most Bible learning tools focus on individual study, completely missing the powerful engagement that comes from real-time competition, shared laughter, and community bonding that live multiplayer games create.
Impact of the Problem:
Churches lack engaging, ready-to-use activities that combine fun and faith
Event coordinators waste hours manually creating Bible content in generic tools
Youth groups and small groups miss opportunities for memorable community-building experiences
The gap between "serious Bible study" and "fun entertainment" remains unfilled
Churches resort to purely secular games because Bible-focused options aren't engaging enough
Why This Problem Matters Now:
Post-COVID, churches are actively seeking digital-first tools that work with devices people already carry (smartphones) and create engaging experiences for all ages. There's growing recognition that spiritual growth happens through community and joy, not just through serious study. Churches want tools that make faith fun and memorable while still being theologically sound.
The competitive gaming mechanics proven by platforms like Kahoot have shown that learning can be entertaining - but no one has built this specifically for Christian communities with Bible-focused content.
Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:
Kahoot: Great mechanics, but churches must create all Bible content from scratch - time-consuming and no guarantee of theological accuracy
Bible Quiz Apps: Solo play only - can't use for group events where the magic happens
Competitive Bible Quiz Software: Too formal and structured for casual youth night or small group fun
Generic Event Software: No Bible-specific features, expensive, complex setup

Proposed Solution
Bible Memory Quiz Game is a live, multiplayer quiz platform purpose-built for Christian communities that combines the proven engagement mechanics of Kahoot with Bible-specific content and AI-enhanced visuals.
Core Solution Approach:
The platform enables churches to run exciting quiz events in minutes with zero preparation:
Host creates a game room → Selects from curated Bible question sets → Generates QR code
Participants scan QR code or enter room ID → Join on their phones → See their name on the projector
Live gameplay begins → Questions appear on projector and phones → Players race to answer → Leaderboard updates in real-time
AI-enhanced learning moments → After each question, stunning AI-generated Biblical imagery appears on the projector showing the correct answer's subject (e.g., Bethlehem scene for "Where was Jesus born?")
Key Differentiators:
1. Zero Prep Time with Curated Content
Pre-made question sets covering major Bible themes (Gospels, Old Testament Heroes, Miracles, Parables)
100 theologically accurate questions at launch
No manual quiz creation required - just pick a theme and play
2. Kahoot-Style Mechanics for Churches
QR code + Room ID joining (no app download required)
Real-time competitive gameplay
Projector display for group viewing
Phone-based answer submission
Live leaderboards after each question
Speed + accuracy scoring system
3. AI-Generated Biblical Visuals (Unique to Market)
Every correct answer paired with relevant AI-generated imagery
Projector displays stunning 5-second visual of the answer subject
Creates "wow" moments that reinforce learning
Phones show static images for bandwidth efficiency
4. Built for Ministry Context
All ages appropriate content
Denomination-neutral question sets
Theologically sound and accurate
Designed for church events, not just education
5. Freemium B2C → B2B Church Model
Individuals and small groups can try for free (limited access)
Success at small scale drives church-wide adoption
Affordable church licensing unlocks full platform
Why This Solution Will Succeed:
Proven Mechanics + Purpose-Built Content: Takes the engagement model churches already love (Kahoot) and makes it Bible-specific with zero setup friction
Fills a Real Gap: No competitor offers Bible-focused, live multiplayer for casual church events with ready-to-use content
AI Visual Differentiator: The Biblical imagery creates memorable moments no competitor can match
Frictionless Adoption: Works on devices people already have (phones + laptop/projector), no special hardware or complex setup
Smart Go-to-Market: Free tier lets champions test and prove value before asking for church budget approval
Time = Money: Saves hours of manual quiz creation, making the church license an easy ROI justification
High-Level Product Vision:
Starting with in-person events (MVP), the platform will expand to support:
Online multiplayer for remote participants
Team-based competitions
Custom question uploads (premium feature)
Seasonal content (Advent, Lent, Easter)
Integration with church management systems
The ultimate vision is to become the default platform for Bible-based competitive fun in Christian communities worldwide - making scripture engagement as exciting as game night.

Segment 2: Senior Pastors (Established Churches)
Profile:
Age: 45-65 years old
Role: Lead pastor or executive pastor
Church size: 200-1000+ members
Tech comfort: Moderate (delegates implementation to staff)
Decision power: Approves budgets and new tools
Current Behaviors:
Focus on overall church health, growth, and engagement
Evaluate tools based on ROI and mission alignment
Approve annual ministry budgets
Want tools that serve multiple age groups and ministries
Delegate day-to-day operations to ministry staff
Pain Points:
Churches need better community engagement tools
Want to reach all ages (not just youth)
Concerned about budget allocation and recurring costs
Need tools that multiple ministries can share
Want to see clear metrics on engagement and participation
Goals & Motivations:
Foster community and fellowship across the church
Effective stewardship of church resources

Positive member feedback and participation
Multi-ministry use cases (youth, small groups, events)
Willingness to Pay:
Church: $300-500/year if tool serves multiple ministries
Needs to see proven value from staff before approving

User Journey: B2C → B2B Conversion Path
Phase 1: Individual Discovery (Youth Pastor)
Youth pastor discovers platform (social media, word of mouth)
Creates free account to test at youth night
Runs quiz with 20-30 youth - huge success, kids love it
Uses free tier for 2-3 events, hits limitations
Phase 2: Proof of Concept 5. Youth pastor mentions success to other staff (small group leaders, children's ministry) 6. Multiple leaders start using free tier 7. Church has 3-4 groups all wanting more features
Phase 3: Church-Wide Adoption 8. Youth pastor presents case to senior pastor: "Multiple ministries want this, church license makes sense" 9. Senior pastor evaluates: Multiple ministries benefit + affordable cost = approval 10. Church license unlocked for all ministries
Phase 4: Sustained Use 11. Tool becomes regular part of church culture (youth nights, family events, small groups) 12. Annual renewal is easy decision due to proven engagement

Why This Two-Segment Focus Works:
Youth Pastors are:
Champions and early adopters
Drive initial usage and proof of concept
Tech-savvy enough to test independently
Have direct access to engaged audiences (youth)
Can create viral moments (youth talk about fun events)
Senior Pastors are:
Budget approvers and decision makers
Care about church-wide impact, not just one ministry
Need ROI justification for any new tool
Want tools that serve multiple demographics
Value staff time and effectiveness
The Bridge: Youth pastor proves value → Senior pastor sees broader opportunity → Church-wide adoption
This creates a natural funnel: Individual use (free) → Organizational licensing (paid)

Real-Time Game State Management:
Supabase Realtime Channels ("Game Channels")
What is a Game Channel? A game channel is Supabase Realtime's way of creating isolated "rooms" for each game session. Think of it like a radio station - everyone playing the same game tunes into the same channel to receive real-time updates.
How It Works:
typescript
// Each game creates unique channel: 'game:abc-123-def'
// Host, Player 1, Player 2 all subscribe to same channel
// When anything happens, everyone receives update instantly

const gameChannel = supabase.channel(`game:${gameId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'game_players' },
    (payload) => {
      // New player joined - update UI
    }
  )
  .on('broadcast', 
    { event: 'question_advance' },
    (payload) => {
      // Host advanced to next question - sync all screens
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

**Key Real-Time Events:**
- `player_joined` - New player enters game
- `question_advance` - Move to next question
- `answer_submitted` - Player submits answer
- `timer_sync` - Keep timers in sync
- `leaderboard_update` - Score changes
- `game_end` - Game completion

Performance Considerations:
Image Loading Strategy
Pre-load: Load next 3 questions' images while current question is active
Compression: Optimize images to <200KB each
CDN: Supabase Storage serves via CDN for fast global delivery
Fallback: Generic placeholder if image fails to load
Real-Time Optimization
Channel Presence: Track active connections, handle disconnects gracefully
Debouncing: Batch rapid updates to prevent UI thrashing
Optimistic Updates: Update UI immediately, sync in background
Bandwidth Considerations
Host: Loads full images for projector (~2MB total for 20 questions)
Players: Load smaller compressed versions (~500KB total)
Sync Strategy: Only send necessary data (answer choice, not full question text)

Security & Performance:
Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
sql
-- Games: Only host can update their games
CREATE POLICY "Hosts can update their games"
ON games FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = host_id);

-- Players: Anyone can insert as player (for anonymous joining)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can join as player"
ON game_players FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Answers: Players can only insert their own answers
CREATE POLICY "Players submit own answers"
ON player_answers FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (player_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM game_players WHERE game_id = player_answers.game_id
));

Constraints & Assumptions
Constraints:
Budget Constraints
Development Costs:
Solo developer - No labor costs beyond your time
API Costs (MVP phase):
OpenAI DALL-E 3: ~$8 for 200 images (one-time pre-generation)
Supabase: Free tier initially (1GB database, 2GB file storage, 50GB bandwidth)
Vercel: Free tier (100GB bandwidth, unlimited deployments)
Estimated MVP Cost: <$50 total
Scaling Costs (Post-Launch):
Supabase Pro: $25/mo when free tier exhausted
Vercel Pro: $20/mo if needed (unlikely for MVP)
OpenAI: Additional image generation as content library grows
Target: Stay under $100/mo operating costs until $500+ MRR
Timeline Constraints
MVP Target: 4-6 weeks from start to launch
Week 1-2: Core game mechanics + database setup
Week 3: Real-time sync + projector/player views
Week 4: Question library + AI image generation
Week 5: Polish, testing, bug fixes
Week 6: Soft launch with beta testers
Constraint Reality:
Solo developer = limited bandwidth
Must balance speed with quality
Technical debt acceptable if shipped on time
Technical Constraints
Internet Dependency:
Requires stable internet connection for all participants
Church WiFi quality varies widely (potential issue)
No offline mode in MVP
Mitigation: Optimize for low bandwidth, progressive image loading
Browser Compatibility:
Must work on iOS Safari (iPhones) and Chrome (Android)
No native app = limited to browser capabilities
Can't control device notifications/interruptions
Assumption: 90%+ of users on modern mobile browsers
Supabase Free Tier Limits:
500MB database size
1GB file storage (for images)
2GB egress (bandwidth) per month
200 concurrent real-time connections (sufficient for 6-7 simultaneous games)
Research Validated: Supabase Realtime handles thousands of concurrent users in production
Device Requirements:
Host needs laptop/tablet + projector or large screen
Players need smartphones with camera (for QR scanning)
Assumption: Churches have basic AV setup (projector + WiFi)
Resource Constraints
Content Creation:
Limited time to create 100 questions with theological accuracy
Need to research and verify Biblical facts
Image generation requires thoughtful prompting
Mitigation: Focus on 5 well-curated sets vs. quantity
No Design Resources:
Solo developer = no professional designer
Relying on shadcn/ui components for UI
Assumption: Clean, functional UI > flashy design for MVP
No Marketing Budget:
Relying entirely on organic/word-of-mouth growth
No paid ads, no PR agency
Strategy: Launch in youth ministry networks, leverage personal connections

Key Assumptions:
Market Assumptions
Assumption 1: Churches Want This
Churches actively seek engaging Bible activities
Current solutions (Kahoot + manual creation) are painful enough to switch
Validation Needed: 10+ youth pastor interviews confirming pain point
Assumption 2: Freemium → Church License Works
Individual users will try free tier
Success at small scale leads to church-wide adoption
Churches allocate $300-500/year for proven tools
Risk: Conversion rate might be lower than 10%
Assumption 3: Competition Won't Copy Quickly
Kahoot won't add Bible-specific features soon
Bible quiz app makers won't pivot to live multiplayer
Window of opportunity exists for 6-12 months
Risk: Larger players could replicate with more resources
User Behavior Assumptions
Assumption 4: QR Code + Room ID Joining Works
Youth and adults comfortable scanning QR codes post-COVID
Room ID as backup for those who struggle with QR scanning
No app download friction is major advantage
Validation: QR code adoption is mainstream now
Assumption 5: Users Trust AI-Generated Content
AI-generated Biblical imagery feels appropriate, not irreverent
Visual quality sufficient for church context
Risk: Some denominations may reject AI content; need to test messaging
Assumption 6: Real-Time Sync Is Reliable
Supabase Realtime handles 20+ concurrent connections smoothly (research validated)
Church WiFi adequate for real-time gameplay
Validated: Supabase built on Phoenix/Elixir, proven at scale
Technical Assumptions
Assumption 7: Next.js 15 + Supabase Stack Sufficient
No need for custom backend infrastructure
Supabase Realtime scales to MVP needs (validated by research)
Vercel handles traffic without issues
Validation: Supabase handles thousands of concurrent users in production
Assumption 8: Pre-Generated Images Scale
100 images sufficient for MVP launch
Can generate more as library grows
Image loading fast enough on church WiFi
Risk: Large image library could slow performance; need optimization
Assumption 9: Browser-Only Approach Acceptable
PWA (Progressive Web App) provides "app-like" feel
No native app needed for MVP
Users don't require offline functionality
Note: Capacitor or similar can convert to native app in Phase 2 if needed
Business Model Assumptions
Assumption 10: Pricing Is Market-Appropriate
$12.99/mo Pro tier competitive with similar tools
$299/yr church license within church budget ranges
Free tier valuable enough to drive adoption
Validation Needed: Survey 20+ churches about budget allocation
Assumption 11: B2C Growth Drives B2B Sales
Individual champions successfully advocate for church licenses
Church leadership approves based on staff recommendations
Risk: Decision-making process might be longer than expected
Assumption 12: 10% Conversion Rate Achievable
1 in 10 free users converts to paid within 3 months
Risk: Actual conversion might be 3-5%; adjust projections accordingly
Content Assumptions
Assumption 13: Denomination-Neutral Content Works
Broad Christian content appeals across denominations
Avoiding controversial theological topics keeps audience wide
Risk: Some churches want denomination-specific content
Assumption 14: Theological Accuracy Is Sufficient
Solo developer can verify Biblical facts accurately
Users trust content without formal endorsement
Mitigation: Cite scripture references, allow user reporting of errors

Risk Mitigation Strategies:
High-Impact Risks
Risk 1: Real-Time Sync Fails at Scale
Research Shows: Supabase Realtime handles thousands of users, built on Phoenix/Elixir
Risk Level: LOW (was Medium, now validated)
Mitigation: Load test with 50+ simulated users before launch
Fallback: Graceful degradation - show "reconnecting" state
Risk 2: Churches Don't Convert to Paid
Mitigation: Make free tier valuable but clearly limited
Experiment: Test different free tier limits (3 vs 5 games/month)
Backup Plan: Focus on individual Pro subscriptions if B2B slow
Risk 3: Content Quality Concerns
Mitigation: Have 3-5 Christians review questions for accuracy
Beta Testing: Soft launch with 10 churches for feedback
Quick Fix: Easy way for users to report question issues
Risk 4: Larger Competitor Enters
Mitigation: Move fast, build community, lock in early adopters
Differentiation: AI visuals + curated content = defensible moat
Pivot Ready: Can expand to adjacent markets if needed

Success Dependencies:
Must Be True for Success:
✅ Churches have reliable WiFi (mostly true post-COVID)
✅ Youth pastors have budget influence (validated assumption)
✅ Real-time sync works smoothly (technical validation via research)
✅ AI images enhance experience (beta testing will confirm)
✅ Free → Paid conversion happens (requires experimentation)
Nice to Have But Not Critical:
Native mobile apps (can add via Capacitor later)
Offline mode (niche use case, excluded for MVP)
White-label branding (enterprise feature for future)
Video content (Phase 2)
